#  -------------
#  â€£ This script only runs on macOS using Bash 3.0+
#  â€£ Requires Xcode Command Line Tools.
#
#  What It Does
#  ------------
#  Running this script will pull all the latest changes from the current branch, create a "version bump" commit, then tag that commit.
#  These changes are done for production and are pushed to the remote `origin` repository which subsequently kicks off workflows defined
#  in CircleCI which ultimately uploads a production builds to the app store.
